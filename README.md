PXaaS Dashboard
============================

The PXaaS Dashboard enables a user, who acts as the network administrator of his LAN, to configure the Squid Proxy on demand. The configuration parameters are stored in a MySql Database. In order for a new configuration to take effect, the squid.conf and squidGuard.conf files are modified accordingly by the apache process (after a Squid restart is performed by the user).
